Here are common queue operations available for manipulating data elements in C:

enqueue(data): Adds an element to the end(Rear) of the queue.

dequeue(): Removes and returns the element at the front of the queue.

peek(): Returns the element at the front of the queue without removing it.

isEmpty(): Checks if the queue is empty(Front = Rear =NULL).

size(): Returns the number of elements in the queue.

clear(): Empties the queue, removing all elements.
